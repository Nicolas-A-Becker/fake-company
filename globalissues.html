				<li>Thoughtfully and purposefully identify and collaborate with NGO/nonprofit partners who bring expertise as well as credibility, relationships, and access to communities where the company seeks to engage.</li>
				<li>Companies can increase the scale of the problem by linking their own business model to social problems and seeking solutions,making other companies/communities join to solve the problem.
