				<h2>Business Communications Issues:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><b>The use of inappropriate tool of communication</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>The timely use of appropriate communication tools is very important for internal communication. Using the proper tool for communication helps engage in more efficient communication among employees.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Emails</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>A 2005 study found that although 50 percent of all online communication is misunderstood, senders believe that their message is being received clearly, where it becomes a problem with the receiver when there is a lack of tone/body language to give context.</li>
						<li>One of the growing internal communication problems is missing important internal emails. It happens because employees, especially senior executives, receive huge amounts of emails.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>Inappropriate/Unclear Feedback</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Feedback is the most important part of all communication processes. It helps the recipient understand the sender's actual intention behind the message. Complete communication in a comprehensive and meaningful way. Lack of feedback leads to misinterpretation of interactions. This creates a communication barrier that prevents employees from decrypting the true purpose behind the message. It is a place where work inefficiency and dissatisfaction explode.</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
