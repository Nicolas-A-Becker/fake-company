			<h1>Healthy Work Environments</h1>
			<p>
				Healthy work environments are continuously proving more necessary in the modern world. A healthy work environment provides not only the employee with a healthier workspace physically and mentally, but it also bennefits the employer. 
				<br><br>
				Research has been done throughout the years attempting to establish a correlation between an employee's happiness and their productivity. One such <a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=227111111064074003002116101065071086097034061055016020027101089099121006094008074096030000020103007009008122077022093069019093051007069048051080072116119081092102105069092085030083066003010071080070007125095071002073123020094011015003086121006123116098&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE">research paper</a> states that happiness as affected by one's environment, even down to weather, effects productivity to an impressive degree. Even just keeping windows shut durring rainy or poor weather was show to change both mood and productivity. With these significantly proven ideas about happiness and productivity it follows that a company that puts more time into establishing a healthy work environment would have a leg up on those that don't. Instances of 13% increase in individual productivity have even been noted between reportedly happy and unhappy employees. Unhappy or unfocused employees are also reported to wander or spend significantly more time off task than those who are happy and focused. With all this proof it would be hard to justify <b>not</b> putting time into keeping your employees happy, but how can that be done?

			<h2>Creating a Healthy Work Environment</h2>
			<p>
				<b>What the Employer Can Do:</b><br>
				The employer can make alot of moves towards creating healthy work environments.
				</p>
				<ul class="secondary">
					<li>Employers provide desks, chairs, and necessary tools or devices at most jobs. This is an easy place for a company to purchase ergonomic chairs, adjustable or standing desks, easy to use computers and software, and better tools for their employees. The more that a company puts into setting an employee up for success the more the employee will appreciate the effort.</li>
					<li>Employees can be rewarded and recognized for exemplary work to provide proof and aknowledgement of work by the company.</li>
					<li>Good management is one of the more important aspects of what makes an employee like any particular job. Good understanding managers will encourage respect and loyalty more than almost any other singular thing a company can do.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>What the Employee Can Do:</b></p>
				<ul class="secondary">
					<li>Take small breaks to get up and walk around. Staying active is very important for physical and mental health so little breaks to provide some physical activity will help.</li>
					<li>Proper posture and ergonomic desk gatchets(ie. mouse, keyboard, wrist pads) will help with joint pain in the long run</li>
					<li>Proper diet and eating are proven to increase mood and energy</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				<b>In Conclusion:</b><br>
				Healthy work environments aren't just a popular phrase to throw around in management meetings but an important tool to reach goals and increase general productivity in the workplace. There are many steps that employees and employers can take to increase the comfort and happiness of any individual employee, many of which are cheap or free, that will massively increase productivity. In order to remain competetive in an ever changing market employee happiness must be considered at all times.<br><br>
